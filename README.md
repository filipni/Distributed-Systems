# Distributed-Systems
Lab assignments for the Distributed Systems course we took in school.

## Lab 1 - Simple Distributed Blackboard
A simple version of the blackboard that gives no guarantees to the user.

## Lab 2 - Centralized communication version
All nodes are now part of a ring structure where all communication goes through a coordinator.

## Lab 3 - Eventually Consistent Blackboard
This version implements eventual consistency without the need for a coordinator.

## Lab 4 - Byzantine Agreement
Not really a blackboard, but shows how all the nodes can come to an agreement in the presence of a Byzantine fault.
